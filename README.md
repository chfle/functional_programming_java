## FAQ

### Why should we use functional programming?

Functional programming in Java can lead to more concise 
and expressive code, as it emphasizes the use of 
functions and immutable data structures. 
Additionally, it can help reduce the 
likelihood of errors and improve the overall maintainability of code.

### Can we use oop and functional programming together? 

Yes, it is possible to use object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP) together.

### How can functional programming help us?

functional programming encourages 
breaking down complex problems into smaller, 
more manageable functions that can be composed 
and combined to solve larger problems. 
This approach can help improve code modularity and make 
it easier to reason about and test individual components of a program.
